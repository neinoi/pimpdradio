==========

A raspberry pi Radio based on MPD

Forked from Bob Rathbone work : https://github.com/bobrathbone/piradio

Goals : 
 - Working with Mpd's database rather than file system (For huge collections)
 - Working with color lcd display (like Adafruit's http://www.adafruit.com/products/1480)

Current :
 - Only 20x4 Lcd display
 - Only radio
 - Stability problems
